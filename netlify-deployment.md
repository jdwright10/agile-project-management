# Quick Deployment with Netlify Drop

If you want an even faster way to deploy your Agile Project Management app and share it with others, you can use Netlify Drop. This doesn't require git configuration or any command line usage.

## Steps to Deploy with Netlify Drop

1. Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) in your web browser
2. Drag and drop your entire project folder (or just the `index.html` and `src` directory) onto the Netlify Drop area
3. Wait a few seconds for the upload and deployment to complete
4. Netlify will generate a unique URL where your site is published (e.g., `https://random-name-123456.netlify.app`)
5. Share this URL with anyone you want to show your app to!

## Advantages of Netlify Drop

- No sign-up required (though creating a free Netlify account lets you manage your site)
- Instant deployment with a public URL
- No git or command line knowledge needed
- Automatic HTTPS security

## Updating Your Site

If you make changes to your app and want to update the deployed version, you can simply drag and drop your updated files to Netlify Drop again.

If you create a Netlify account, you can log in and manage your site, including:
- Changing the site name to something more memorable
- Setting up a custom domain
- Viewing analytics
- Redeploying when you make changes

This is the fastest way to get your project online to share with others!

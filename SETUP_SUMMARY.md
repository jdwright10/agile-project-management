# Health Coach App Setup Summary

## What We've Done

We have set up a comprehensive React Native / Expo application for the Health Coach app with the following components:

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created a well-organized directory structure
   - Set up TypeScript for type safety
   - Configured Expo and React Native settings

2. **Navigation**
   - Implemented a complete navigation system with:
     - Authentication flow
     - Tab navigation for main app sections
     - Stack navigation for related screens
   - Defined proper type definitions for navigation

3. **Screens**
   - Developed multiple key screens including:
     - Login and Signup for authentication
     - Home dashboard
     - Food tracking with camera and barcode scanning
     - Reports with data visualization
     - User profile management

4. **Components**
   - Created reusable UI components:
     - Buttons with multiple variants
     - Text inputs with validation
     - Custom charts and progress indicators
     - Cards and list items

5. **State Management**
   - Implemented context providers:
     - ThemeContext for dark/light mode
     - UserContext for user data and authentication
   - Set up local storage handling

6. **Type Definitions**
   - Added comprehensive TypeScript declarations
   - Created interface definitions for props and state
   - Resolved module import issues

## Running the App

To preview the app, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using the convenience script

Run the provided shell script which takes care of all setup and startup:

```bash
./preview-app.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual setup

1. Navigate to the app directory:
   ```bash
   cd healthcoach-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app in web mode (fastest for preview):
   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```
   
   Or for mobile development:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Known Issues and Limitations

- The app currently uses mock data - no backend connection is implemented
- Some TypeScript errors might still appear but shouldn't prevent the app from running
- Assets are placeholders and would need to be replaced with real designs
- Navigation between certain screens might need refinement

## Next Steps

To complete the application, consider:

1. Connecting to a real backend API or implementing a local database
2. Adding real authentication (Firebase, Auth0, etc.)
3. Implementing actual food recognition functionality
4. Designing and adding proper assets and icons
5. Adding unit and integration tests
6. Configuring the app for production deployment
